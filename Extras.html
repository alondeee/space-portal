            <h3>Quark Stars</h3>
            <p>
              A hypothetical intermediate state between neutron stars and black
              holes. The idea is that under the immense pressure at the core of
              a massive neutron star, neutrons themselves "dissolve" into a soup
              of their constituent quarks (up, down, and strange quarks),
              creating "strange matter." The entire star would be a giant,
              single hadron or a uniform quark-gluon plasma.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Status: No confirmed observation. Some astronomers propose that
                objects like 3C 58 or the compact object in SN 1987A might be
                quark star candidates if their observed mass/radius is smaller
                than neutron star models allow, but they are still classified as
                neutron stars.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Preon Stars</h3>
            <p>
              An even more speculative theoretical object. The idea is that if
              quarks and leptons are composed of smaller, more fundamental
              particles called preons, then under extreme densities, a star
              could collapse to a preon degenerate state. They would be
              incredibly dense, possibly acting as dark matter candidates or
              seeds for supermassive black holes.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Status: Purely hypothetical. No evidence for preons exists in
                particle physics.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Boson Stars</h3>
            <p>
              Hypothetical stars composed not of fermions (protons, neutrons,
              electrons) but of bosons. Bosons (like photons, gluons, or
              hypothetical particles such as axions) can occupy the same quantum
              state. A boson star would be a giant "Bose-Einstein condensate"
              held together by its own gravity.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Relevance: Often discussed as a possible dark matter candidate.
                Unlike black holes, they would have no event horizon and could
                be transparent. They could potentially mimic black hole
                signatures in gravitational wave detections.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Gravastars (GRAVitational VAcuum STARS)</h3>
            <p>
              A theoretical alternative to black holes proposed within General
              Relativity. Instead of a singularity and event horizon, a
              gravastar has a superfluid core of dark energy (negative pressure)
              and a thin, ultra-dense shell of ordinary matter. No event
              horizon, potentially resolving the information paradox.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Status: Highly speculative. No known mechanism for their
                formation. Distinguishing them from black holes via observation
                (e.g., with the Event Horizon Telescope) is an active
                theoretical challenge.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hypervelocity Stars (HVS)</h3>
            <p>
              Stars moving at speeds exceeding the galactic escape velocity (≳
              700 km/s in the Milky Way). They are unbound and will leave the
              galaxy.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Primary Origin: The Hills Mechanism—a binary star system is torn
                apart by the supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) at the Galactic
                Center. One star is captured, the other is ejected at immense
                speed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Example: S5-HVS1, a main-sequence star ejected from Sgr A* at
                ~1700 km/s.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Runaway Stars</h3>
            <p>
              High-velocity stars (tens to hundreds of km/s) still bound to the
              galaxy, moving much faster than local stellar populations.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Two Origins: Dynamical Ejection (kicked out of a dense young
                star cluster by gravitational slingshot) and Supernova Ejection
                (the primary star in a binary explodes, disrupting the system
                and launching the secondary).
              </li>
              <li>
                Example: ζ Ophiuchi, a massive O-star with a prominent bow
                shock.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Carbon Stars (C-type; C > O)</h3>
            <p>
              Cool, late-type (K-M) giants/supergiants where the carbon
              abundance exceeds oxygen (C/O > 1) in their atmospheres. This
              allows carbon molecules (C₂, CN, CH, SiC₂) to form, giving them a
              very red color and distinct spectrum (strong Swan bands of C₂).
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Formation: Typically asymptotic giant branch (AGN) stars in the
                third dredge-up phase, where convection brings carbon
                synthesized in the He-burning shell to the surface.
              </li>
              <li>
                Example: R Leporis ("Hind's Crimson Star"), a famously red
                variable carbon star.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>S-type Stars (C ≈ O)</h3>
            <p>
              Transition objects between M-type and Carbon stars, where carbon
              and oxygen abundances are nearly equal (C/O ≈ 1). Their spectra
              show zirconium oxide (ZrO) bands (instead of titanium oxide, TiO,
              in M stars) along with carbon features.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Formation: Also AGB stars, but at an earlier stage of carbon
                enrichment than full carbon stars.
              </li>
              <li>Example: π¹ Gruis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Barium Stars (Ba stars)</h3>
            <p>
              Cool, luminous giants (G-K) with strong spectral lines of
              s-process elements (barium, strontium, lanthanum). They are not
              massive enough to produce these elements themselves.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Solution: They are all members of binary systems. The
                s-process elements were created in the now-dead AGB companion
                (currently a white dwarf) and transferred to the Ba star via
                stellar wind or mass transfer.
              </li>
              <li>Example: ζ Capricorni.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CH Stars</h3>
            <p>
              A subclass of Population II, metal-poor giants that show very
              strong CH (methylidyne) bands and enhanced s-process elements.
              They are the low-metallicity, halo analogues of Ba stars.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Origin: Also binary mass transfer from a former AGB companion,
                but in the ancient stellar halo.
              </li>
              <li>Example: HD 26 (a bright CH star in the galactic halo).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Magnetic Stars (Ap/Bp stars)</h3>
            <p>
              A subclass of main-sequence A- and B-type stars with strong,
              globally organized magnetic fields (hundreds of Gauss to tens of
              kiloGauss). "Ap" stands for "peculiar A-type."
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Key Features: Chemical Peculiarities (abnormal overabundances of
                silicon, strontium, chromium, europium, etc.), Stellar Spots,
                and Slow Rotation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Example: Alioth (ε Ursae Majoris), the brightest Ap star in the
                sky.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Megamasers</h3>
            <p>
              Extremely powerful, naturally occurring masers (Microwave
              Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). They are
              millions to billions of times more luminous than typical stellar
              masers found in our Galaxy's star-forming regions.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mechanism: They arise in dense molecular gas around the nuclei
                of active galaxies, often pumped by intense radiation from the
                central AGN or by shocks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Example: Arp 220 (OH megamaser), NGC 4258 (H₂O megamaser).
              </li>
            </ul>

              A theoretical hybrid star consisting of a red supergiant (or
              hypergiant) star with a neutron star core, instead of a normal
              stellar core.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Signature: Outer layers look like a cool, luminous red
                supergiant, but spectra show extreme overabundances of lithium,
                rubidium, molybdenum, and other heavy elements.
              </li>
              <li>

            <p>
              Non-supergiant B-type stars whose spectra have, or have had at
              some time, one or more Balmer emission lines (especially Hα). They
              are rapidly rotating (near critical breakup velocity), leading to
              the formation of a decretion disk of gas ejected from the star's
              equator.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Behavior: Often variable, with disks that can form and dissipate
                over years to decades.
